**Project Overview:**

The goal of my project was to analyze a restaurant dataset to uncover important insights about the most popular cuisines, how restaurants are rated in different cities, and how they are priced. I used Python as the main tool for this analysis, working in a platform called Google Colab, which allowed me to write code and see the results directly.

I completed three main tasks as part of this project, and I'll explain each one step by step.

**Task 1: Identifying Top Cuisines**

The first part of my project was to find out which cuisines were the most popular. To do this, I analyzed the data to identify the top three cuisines served by the most restaurants. The results showed that North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food were the top choices, with North Indian being the most common. This insight can help new restaurant owners understand what kind of food is in demand.

**Task 2: City Analysis â€“ Ratings and Restaurant Numbers**

Next, I wanted to understand how restaurants are distributed across different cities and how they are rated by customers. I found that New Delhi had the highest number of restaurants, accounting for around 30% of all restaurants in the dataset. Interestingly, the city with the highest average rating was Mumbai, with an average rating of 4.2 out of 5. This means that, according to customer feedback, Mumbai restaurants are generally seen as offering better quality or service.

**Task 3: Price Range Analysis**

In the final task, I analyzed how restaurants are priced. I created a visualization showing the distribution of price ranges, from inexpensive to very expensive. The most common category was "Moderate," indicating that most restaurants aim to offer affordable options. In contrast, very few restaurants fell into the "Very Expensive" category, showing that not many target high-end customers.
